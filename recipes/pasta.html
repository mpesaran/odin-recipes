    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This family-favorite angel chicken recipe is full of flavor and easy to make with condensed soup and cream
        cheese. It's special enough to serve when you're entertaining guests. I usually double the recipe so we can have
        leftovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch
            baking dish.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine.
            Add
            cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1
            hour.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling
            boil.
            Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
            Drain.</li>
    </ol>
