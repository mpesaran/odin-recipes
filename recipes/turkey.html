    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cooking turkey in a bag is easy with this recipe. Your Thanksgiving turkey will be perfectly moist when done, and
        you can make gravy out of the juice that forms in the bottom of the bag. Plus, cleanup is a snap! The cooking
        time will vary if your turkey is larger or smaller than 12 pounds.</p>
